# This Branch is the "Libxft-bgra-dead-zone"
## Since [Libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra) is unable to compile or [installed](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS/issues/179), which breaks joypixel color emoji rendering which breaks st which breaks litterally every scripts from larbs which has emojis in it. 
From DWM to st and all the other scripts wont working. 
Thats why I had to go with different Approach :
Terminal          : **TYM** 
WM                : **Spectrwm** 
Emoji Font        : **Noto Emoji Fonts**

And thats why I had to create this another branch.
