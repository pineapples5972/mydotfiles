#MY DWM ARTIX RICE 
## Based on LARBS.xyz 
These are dotfiles that I changed/modified/added to get best of larbs.

**Here are three branches:**
   1. master
   2. libxft-bgra-dead-zone
   3. twilight
__________________________________

1. Master: 
  - this build is years old
  - uses moc, vifm, dmenu,  rofi and other custom scripts
 
2. libxft-bgra-dead-zone
  - This branch emerged when I was using void linux
  - and libxft-bgra simply refused to  install 
  - because one of its dependacy upgraded and messed it up
  - specially made for spectrwm 

3. twilight zone
  - this zone emerged when i was fall in love with twemoji
  - and installed artix on second drive
  - here i changed dwm dramatically 
  - most of the keybinds ported to sxhkd
  - various new patches applied on st
  - working slim login manager with my custom theme
  
**Dotfiles common in all branches**

 - Music Player: Moc (Music On Console)
 - visualizer: cava
